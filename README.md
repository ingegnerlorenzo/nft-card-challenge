## My process

At first, I didn't workout how to takle this challenge. After one try, I decided to switch to a mobile first approach. I worked highlighting the borders of all the element on the page. I am quite happy with the way I worked out a solution. After that, it didn't took me so much time to finish the entire challenge. I am happy but not completly satisfied as I know I could do better and be more patient. Being consistent is key and having some "NO" days is normal, part of the process. 

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to be patient. At first I didn't understood what I failed. But then, rethinking the way I was coding and breathing help me getting out of trouble and doing a good (yet not perfect) job. I am looking forward to deepen my knowledge. 

### Continued development

I want to fully understand the flexbox model and start learning the grid model. I am currently watching a ton of videos on YT and trying coding on many web apps and in VS code. Thanks to frontend Mentor I feel as I am engaged with real project.

Thanks to the YT videos of Kyle Powell and his calm approach. It made me feel as it is normal to fail and get mad with CSS sometimes.
